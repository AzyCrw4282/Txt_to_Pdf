Problem,steps:

	given a series of commands and text, format it as requried. It should take in a txt file and then produce a pdf file with the a given text.
	
	create unit testing to test each function and method, for the being just output stdout( outpouyts to standard output stream so always unformated)
	use ANSI.
	
	use MVN project, with predefined text doc. stdin to required user disk directory to save the output.
	
	use java objects to do the rest. Will follow somewhat a TDD approach.
	
	
	
notes:


change all to relative path

assumption that a text to be formatted of one instance after all commands

youy know hw it works atm with the use of the list
	
line termination using scanner to identify the whole text cannot use . as it may exists in the sentence so had to use the current method 	

use of delimiters is preset
